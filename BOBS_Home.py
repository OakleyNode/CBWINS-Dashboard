What are BOBs? They are Bay Observation Boxes! BOBs are
experimental DIY maker built water quality monitoring devices conceived and built
in St. Mary's County\'s (Maryland) Seventh District. BOBs are built using inexpensive
off-the-shelf components for a fraction of the cost of commercially available products.
The first BOB prototype was deployed in Breton Bay in August 2022. Thanks to CBTRUST
MWEE and Oyster Innovation grants, BOB hardware and software is being tested and
refined through the efforts of the student citizen scientists at the Dr. J.A. Forrest
Career and Technology Center and the St. Mary's River Watershed Association. Our other
critical partners are the Town of Leonardtown, the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory,
the Calvert Marine Museum, and the Friends of St. Clements Bay.
