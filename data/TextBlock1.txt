What are BOBs? They are Bay Observation Boxes! BOB are experimental DIY maker built water quality monitoring devices conceived and built in St. Mary's County Seventh District. BOBs are built using inexpensive off-the-shelf components for a fraction of the cost of commercially available products. The first BOB prototype was deployed in Breton Bay in August 2022. Thanks to CBTRUST MWEE and Oyster Innovation grants, BOB hardware and software is being tested and refined through the efforts of student and citizen scientists at the J.A. Forrest Career and Technology center and the St. Mary's River Watershed Association. Our other critical partners are the Town of Leonardtown, the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, the Calvert Marine Museum, and the Friends of St. Clements Bay.
