## CBWINS Dashboard

### **This repo was created to practice (a) coding with Streamlit, (b) using Github and (c) to produce a trial web app layout with some potential content.**

**Objective:**  Build a web application visualizing the water quality data generated by the BOBs, monitoring readings gathered manually by volunteers (typically using a YSI or Hanna handheld meters) and then sprinkling in a variety of publicly available data from such sources as the local USGS monitoring stations, the CBL Paxtuxent Sentinel, Potomac Riverkeepers monitoring for chloroforms and St. Mary's Health department monitoring results for the local beaches.
